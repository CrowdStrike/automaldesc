  Generating thorough natural language explanations for
  threat detections remains an open problem in cybersecurity
  research, despite significant advances in automated
  malware detection systems. In this work, we present
  AutoMalDesc, an automated static analysis summarization
  framework that, following initial training on a small set
  of expert-curated examples, operates independently at
  scale. This approach leverages an iterative self-paced
  learning pipeline to progressively enhance output quality
  through synthetic data generation and validation cycles,
  eliminating the need for extensive manual data annotation.
  Evaluation across 3,600 diverse samples in five scripting
  languages demonstrates statistically significant
  improvements between iterations, showing consistent gains
  in both summary quality and classification accuracy. Our
  comprehensive validation approach combines quantitative
  metrics based on established malware labels with
  qualitative assessment from both human experts and
  LLM-based judges, confirming both technical precision and
  linguistic coherence of generated summaries. To facilitate
  reproducibility and advance research in this domain, we
  publish our complete dataset of more than 100K script
  samples, including annotated seed (0.9K) and test (3.6K)
  datasets, along with our methodology and evaluation
  framework.
